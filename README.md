# FindMissingBinaryNum    
 Given an array A[l .. n-l] of (n- 1) distinct integers from [O .. n-1] assuming n = 2k for some positive integer k. Each entry in A is stored as a binary number. You are only allowed to access one bit of an array entry each time. Derive an algorithm to identify the missing integer, i.e., the integer in [O .. n-1] that is not inA and analyze the time complexity of your algorithm.     
 The time complexity = O(2^n), n is the length of the binary number
